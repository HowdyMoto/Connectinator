# Front Panel Wire Housing

For years, I dreaded the process of plugging the power LED and power switch wires from my PC front panels into their motherboards. I usually used long needle-nose pliers to do the job.

This housing makes the job easy and fast. And, you can make one yourself if you have a 3D printer.

This housing is only for the power LED and power switch. If you have HDD lights you'd like to hook up, this housing won't work.

## Printing the housing
I have printed this housing numerous times with PLA. I prefer to use a 0.25mm nozzle, so your tolerances may vary with other nozzle sizes. File an issue here if you find that the toelrances don't work with other nozzle sizes, and I can make another version with different toelrances.

## Using the housing
First, arrange the wires so that the power LED wires are at the correct polarity. Then, place the power switch wires next to them.

Next, side the housing around the wires by inserting the wires through the small slit in the side. The end with the ridge on it shoudl be facing away from the end of the wires.

Slide the ends of the wires into the receiving end of the housing.

Finally, hold the housing and push all 4 wires on to the motherboard in the correct location.
